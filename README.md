# Assessing Asynchronous Learning's Role in Student Engagement at BINUS University

This repository contains the complete research project for the Survey Sampling Method course, investigating the effectiveness of forum-based asynchronous discussions on student engagement and academic performance at BINUS University.

## Abstract

This study provides a comprehensive analysis of asynchronous online learning within higher education, focusing specifically on the role of forum-based discussions. The project's primary goal was to gather empirical evidence on how these forums impact student participation, perception, and academic outcomes. Through a custom-designed questionnaire distributed to students across various faculties and regions of BINUS University, this research explores the nuances of digital pedagogy to inform best practices and enhance student success in online learning environments.

## Research Objectives

* To measure the level and nature of student engagement in asynchronous discussion forums.
* To understand student perceptions regarding the effectiveness and relevance of forum-based learning.
* To identify key factors that influence active participation and academic performance in online courses.
* To analyze qualitative feedback to provide recommendations for improving the asynchronous learning experience.

## Methodology

This study employed a quantitative and qualitative survey methodology. A custom questionnaire was developed and distributed to collect data on student demographics, engagement levels, and perceptions using Likert-scale and open-ended questions.

A key component of our analysis was the application of **post-stratification weighting**. Due to demographic imbalances in the collected sample, this statistical technique was used to adjust the influence of each response. The weights were calculated based on the true population proportions sourced from the national PDDikti higher education database, ensuring that the final results more accurately reflect the entire student population and mitigate sampling bias.

## Key Analyses Performed

The research involved two primary forms of data analysis, conducted using Python and documented in Jupyter Notebooks:

1.  **Quantitative Analysis**: Statistical tests were performed on the cleaned and weighted survey data to analyze trends, correlations, and significant differences in student responses across various demographic groups.
2.  **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: The open-ended survey responses were analyzed using NLP techniques to extract key themes, sentiments, and common topics, providing deeper qualitative insights into student opinions.

## Key Findings

* While asynchronous forums are a widely used and valued tool, student engagement is often superficial and driven by course requirements rather than intrinsic motivation.
* The presence and active participation of instructors are crucial for fostering high-quality discussions and enhancing the learning experience.
* The forum format raises potential equity concerns, as it may disproportionately benefit students with strong self-direction and time management skills.

## Technologies & Libraries

* **Language**: Python
* **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy, Pingouin
* **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Natural Language Processing**: NLTK, Sastrawi, WordCloud
* **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
